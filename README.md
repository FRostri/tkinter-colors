A simple interface with at least most of the colors that tkinter accepts.

A view of this project is here:

You just can copy the name and paste it as a string in your widget.

I want to give credit to this [page](http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Color_Charts_for_TKinter)
which is where I found it.

I just copied the code and uploaded it to my repo because I don't know
if people find it easy to find the colors they want to use in tkinter.
